# Free vs Pro

GitMem ships with a fully functional free tier. Pro adds cloud storage and advanced features.

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---------|------|-----|
| **Session Management** | Local `.gitmem/` | Supabase PostgreSQL |
| **Recall (scar surfacing)** | Local vector search | Supabase pgvector |
| **Create scars/wins/patterns** | Local JSON files | Supabase with embeddings |
| **Threads** | Local tracking | Persistent across machines |
| **Session history** | Last session only | Full history with search |
| **Semantic search** | Local cache | Supabase pgvector |
| **Multi-agent** | Single machine | Shared cloud storage |
| **Batch operations** | — | Batch scar recording |
| **Transcripts** | — | Save/search session transcripts |
| **Cache management** | — | Status, health, flush tools |
| **Knowledge graph** | — | Triple-based graph traversal |
| **Analytics** | Basic | Full session analytics |

## Tool Count by Tier

| Tier | Tools Available |
|------|----------------|
| Free | 23 core tools |
| Pro | 29 tools (+ batch, transcripts, cache) |
| Dev | 29 tools (same as Pro, for development) |

## When to Upgrade

**Stay on Free if:**
- You're a solo developer
- Your projects are single-machine
- You don't need cross-session semantic search

**Upgrade to Pro if:**
- You need shared memory across machines or teams
- You want full semantic search over learnings
- You need session transcript storage
- You're running multi-agent workflows

## Setting Up Pro

1. Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
2. Run the GitMem migration to set up tables
3. Set environment variables:

```bash
export GITMEM_TIER=pro
export SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
export SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

See [Supabase Setup](/docs/guides/supabase-setup) for detailed instructions.
