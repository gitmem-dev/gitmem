# Getting Started

GitMem gives your AI coding agents institutional memory — the ability to learn from mistakes and remember what works across sessions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 22+** (required by Fumadocs MDX)
- An MCP-compatible client: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# In any git repository
npx gitmem-mcp init
```

This creates:
- `.gitmem/` directory with local storage and starter scars
- `.claude/settings.json` with hooks configuration
- `CLAUDE.md` additions with session ceremony instructions

## What Happens Next

1. **Start a session** — Your agent calls `session_start` to load context
2. **Recall before acting** — Before consequential actions, `recall` surfaces relevant scars
3. **Learn from outcomes** — Create scars, wins, and patterns as you discover them
4. **Close cleanly** — `session_close` persists what happened for future sessions
