# GitMem — Institutional Memory

## What is this?
GitMem gives your AI coding agent persistent memory across sessions. It remembers mistakes (scars), successes (wins), and decisions — so you never repeat the same mistake twice.

## Automatic behaviors

When working on this project, follow these memory protocols:

### Before any task
- Call `recall` with a brief description of what you're about to do
- Review any scars that surface — they're warnings from past experience
- Acknowledge relevant scars before proceeding

### At session start
- Call `session_start` to load context from the last session
- Review open threads from the previous session

### When mistakes happen
- If something breaks unexpectedly, suggest creating a scar with `create_learning`
- Include counter-arguments (why someone might think the mistake is OK)
- Scars need: title, description, severity, and at least 2 counter_arguments

### When things go well
- If a pattern or approach works particularly well, capture it as a win
- Wins help replicate success across sessions

### When making decisions
- For architectural or significant operational decisions, log them with `create_decision`
- Include what alternatives were considered and why they were rejected

### At session end
- On "closing", "done for now", or "wrapping up", call `session_close`
- Reflect on what worked, what broke, and what to do differently
- Record which scars you applied during the session

## Tool quick reference

| Tool | Alias | When to use |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `recall` | `gitmem-r` | Before any task — check for relevant warnings |
| `session_start` | `gitmem-ss` | Beginning of session — load context |
| `session_close` | `gitmem-sc` | End of session — persist learnings |
| `create_learning` | `gitmem-cl` | After mistakes or successes — capture knowledge |
| `create_decision` | `gitmem-cd` | When making choices — log the reasoning |
| `record_scar_usage` | `gitmem-rs` | Track which scars helped |
| `help` | `gitmem-help` | Show all commands |
