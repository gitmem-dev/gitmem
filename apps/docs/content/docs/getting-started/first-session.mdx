# Your First Session

This walkthrough shows you what a GitMem-powered session looks like from your AI agent's perspective.

## 1. Open a Session

```
> "Start a GitMem session"
```

The agent calls `session_start`, which:
- Creates a session with a unique ID
- Loads context from the last session (threads, decisions, rapport)
- Displays a session banner with status

## 2. Recall Before Acting

Before making changes, the agent checks institutional memory:

```
> "Add authentication to the API"
```

The agent calls `recall` with the plan "add authentication":

```
recall({ plan: "add authentication to the API" })
```

GitMem returns relevant scars:
- "JWT token expiry must be validated server-side, not just client-side"
- "Always hash passwords with bcrypt, not SHA-256"

The agent acknowledges these lessons and applies them.

## 3. Create Learnings

When the agent discovers something useful:

```
create_learning({
  learning_type: "scar",
  title: "OAuth redirect URI must match exactly",
  description: "Google OAuth rejects requests where the redirect URI doesn't match character-for-character...",
  severity: "medium",
  counter_arguments: [
    "In development, localhost variations are usually fine",
    "Some providers support wildcard redirects"
  ]
})
```

## 4. Close the Session

```
> "Let's wrap up"
```

The agent calls `session_close`, which persists:
- What was accomplished
- What scars were applied
- Open threads for next session
- A brief reflection

## What You Get

After a few sessions, GitMem builds a knowledge base of:
- **Scars** — Mistakes to avoid (surfaced automatically via recall)
- **Wins** — Approaches that worked well
- **Patterns** — Reusable strategies
- **Decisions** — Architectural choices with rationale
- **Threads** — Unfinished work that carries across sessions
