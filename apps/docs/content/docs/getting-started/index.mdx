# Getting Started

GitMem gives your AI coding agents institutional memory — the ability to learn from mistakes and remember what works across sessions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** (for `npx gitmem init`)
- An MCP-compatible client: [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code), [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), or [Cursor](https://cursor.sh)

## Quick Start (30 seconds)

```bash
# In any project directory
npx gitmem init
```

The interactive wizard detects your existing config and sets up everything:
- `.gitmem/` directory with 12 starter scars
- `.mcp.json` with gitmem server entry
- `CLAUDE.md` with memory protocol instructions
- `.claude/settings.json` with lifecycle hooks and tool permissions
- `.gitignore` updated to exclude `.gitmem/`

Already have `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, or hooks? The wizard merges without destroying your existing config. Re-running is safe — completed steps are skipped.

## What Happens Next

1. **Start a session** — Your agent calls `session_start` to load context
2. **Recall before acting** — Before consequential actions, `recall` surfaces relevant scars
3. **Learn from outcomes** — Create scars, wins, and patterns as you discover them
4. **Close cleanly** — `session_close` persists what happened for future sessions
