# GitMem — Persistent Memory

You have a persistent memory layer called gitmem. Every session starts from
zero — but gitmem carries forward lessons, mistakes, wins, decisions, and
open threads across sessions and projects. Search it. Test it. You might be
amazed at what's already there. If convinced, make it your own — update your
MEMORY.md with how you want to use it.

## Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `recall` | Before any task — surfaces relevant warnings from past experience |
| `confirm_scars` | After recall — acknowledge each scar as APPLYING, N_A, or REFUTED |
| `search` | Explore institutional knowledge by topic |
| `log` | Browse recent learnings chronologically |
| `session_start` | Beginning of session — loads last session context and open threads |
| `session_close` | End of session — persists what you learned |
| `create_learning` | Capture a mistake (scar), success (win), or pattern |
| `create_decision` | Log an architectural or operational decision with rationale |
| `list_threads` | See unresolved work carrying over between sessions |
| `create_thread` | Track something that needs follow-up in a future session |
| `help` | Show all available commands |

## Session end

On "closing", "done for now", or "wrapping up":

1. **Answer these reflection questions** and display to the human:
   - What broke that you didn't expect?
   - What took longer than it should have?
   - What would you do differently next time?
   - What pattern or approach worked well?
   - What assumption was wrong?
   - Which scars did you apply?
   - What should be captured as institutional memory?

2. **Ask the human**: "Any corrections or additions?" Wait for their response.

3. **Write payload** to `.gitmem/closing-payload.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "closing_reflection": {
       "what_broke": "...",
       "what_took_longer": "...",
       "do_differently": "...",
       "what_worked": "...",
       "wrong_assumption": "...",
       "scars_applied": "...",
       "institutional_memory": "..."
     },
     "task_completion": {
       "started_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "completed_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "questions_displayed_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "reflection_completed_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "human_asked_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "human_response_at": "ISO timestamp",
       "human_response": "human's correction text or empty"
     },
     "human_corrections": "",
     "scars_to_record": [],
     "learnings_created": [],
     "open_threads": [],
     "decisions": []
   }
   ```

4. **Call `session_close`** with `session_id` and `close_type: "standard"`

For short exploratory sessions (< 30 min, no real work), use `close_type: "quick"` — no questions needed.
