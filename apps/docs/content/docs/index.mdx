# GitMem

**Institutional memory for AI coding agents.** GitMem is an MCP server that gives AI agents the ability to learn from past mistakes, remember what worked, and share knowledge across sessions.

## What is GitMem?

Every time an AI agent makes a mistake, fixes a bug, or discovers a better approach, that knowledge disappears when the session ends. GitMem captures these lessons as **scars** (mistakes to avoid), **wins** (approaches that worked), and **patterns** (reusable strategies) — then surfaces them automatically before the agent takes similar actions.

## Key Features

- **Automatic Recall** — Before taking action, agents check institutional memory for relevant lessons
- **Session Continuity** — Context carries across sessions via threads and session history
- **Multi-Agent** — Teams of agents share the same institutional memory
- **MCP Native** — Works with any MCP-compatible client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
- **Free Tier** — Local `.gitmem/` storage with no external dependencies

## Quick Start

```bash
npx gitmem init
```

One command sets up everything: `.gitmem/` directory, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, hooks, and permissions. Already have existing config? The wizard merges without destroying anything.
