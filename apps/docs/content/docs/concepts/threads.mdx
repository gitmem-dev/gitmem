# Threads

**Threads** track unresolved work that carries across sessions. When you can't finish something in the current session, create a thread so the next session picks it up.

## Creating Threads

```
create_thread({ text: "Auth middleware needs rate limiting before production deploy" })
```

Threads include:
- A unique thread ID (e.g., `t-a1b2c3d4`)
- Description text
- Creation timestamp
- Optional Linear issue link

## Semantic Deduplication

GitMem uses cosine similarity (threshold > 0.85) to prevent duplicate threads. If you try to create a thread that's semantically identical to an existing one, GitMem returns the existing thread instead.

## Thread Lifecycle

```
create → surface at session_start → resolve
```

1. **Create** — `create_thread` during a session
2. **Surface** — Open threads appear in the next `session_start` banner
3. **Resolve** — `resolve_thread` with a resolution note when complete

## Managing Threads

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `list_threads` | See all open threads |
| `resolve_thread` | Mark a thread as done |
| `cleanup_threads` | Triage by health (active/cooling/dormant) |

### Thread Health

`cleanup_threads` categorizes threads by vitality:

- **Active** — Recently created or referenced
- **Cooling** — Not referenced in a while
- **Dormant** — Untouched for 30+ days (auto-archivable)

### Suggested Threads

`session_start` may suggest threads based on session context. You can:
- **Promote** — `promote_suggestion` converts it to a real thread
- **Dismiss** — `dismiss_suggestion` suppresses it (3 dismissals = permanent suppression)
