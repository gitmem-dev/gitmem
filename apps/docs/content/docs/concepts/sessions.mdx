# Sessions

A **session** is a bounded work period. It starts when an agent calls `session_start` and ends with `session_close`. Sessions provide continuity between conversations.

## Session Lifecycle

### 1. Start

`session_start` initializes a session and loads context:

- Creates a unique session ID
- Loads the last session's context (threads, decisions, rapport notes)
- Identifies the agent type (CLI, Desktop, etc.)
- Returns a formatted session banner

### 2. Work

During the session, the agent:
- Calls `recall` before consequential actions
- Creates learnings (scars, wins, patterns)
- Logs decisions
- Tracks threads for unfinished work

### 3. Close

`session_close` persists the session:

- **Quick close** — Minimal, for short exploratory sessions
- **Standard close** — Full reflection with 9 questions covering what broke, what worked, and what to remember

## Session State

Session state is stored in `.gitmem/`:

```
.gitmem/
├── active-sessions.json         # Registry of active sessions
└── sessions/
    └── <session-id>/
        └── session.json         # Session data, scars surfaced, etc.
```

## Context Loading

When a new session starts, GitMem loads:

| Context | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Open threads | `threads.json` | Unfinished work to continue |
| Recent decisions | Last session | Architectural context |
| Rapport notes | Last session | How the human prefers to work |

## The Closing Ceremony

Standard close asks 9 questions:

1. What broke that you didn't expect?
2. What took longer than it should have?
3. What would you do differently next time?
4. What pattern or approach worked well?
5. What assumption was wrong?
6. Which scars did you apply?
7. What should be captured as institutional memory?
8. How did the human prefer to work? *(rapport)*
9. What collaborative dynamic worked? *(rapport)*

These reflections become context for the next session.
