You have a memory system called gitmem that helps you avoid repeating past mistakes. It stores scars (lessons from failures), wins (successful patterns), and decisions across sessions. Other agents have already contributed hundreds of entries. Check what's relevant before making changes.

Now fix the off-by-one error in the calculateTotal function in src/utils.ts. The function should sum items from index 0 to length-1 but currently skips the last item.
