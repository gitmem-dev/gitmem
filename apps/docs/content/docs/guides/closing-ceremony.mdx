# Closing Ceremony

The closing ceremony is GitMem's session persistence ritual. It captures what happened, what was learned, and what carries forward.

## Quick Close vs Standard Close

| Type | When to Use | What Happens |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Quick** | Short sessions (< 30 min), purely exploratory | Minimal persistence, no reflection |
| **Standard** | All substantive work sessions | Full 9-question reflection |

## Standard Close Flow

### Step 1: Read Session State

The agent reads `.gitmem/active-sessions.json` to recover the session ID and any surfaced scars.

### Step 2: Answer 9 Questions

The agent reflects on:

1. **What broke** that you didn't expect?
2. **What took longer** than it should have?
3. **What would you do differently** next time?
4. **What pattern worked** well?
5. **What assumption was wrong?**
6. **Which scars** did you apply?
7. **What should be captured** as institutional memory?
8. **How did the human prefer to work?** (rapport)
9. **What collaborative dynamic** worked or didn't? (rapport)

### Step 3: Human Review

The agent asks: "Any corrections or additions?"

This human checkpoint prevents false learnings from being persisted.

### Step 4: Create Learnings

Any new scars, wins, or patterns identified in Q7 are created **before** session close.

### Step 5: Persist

`session_close` writes the full session record with:
- Close compliance metadata
- Scar usage records
- Open threads
- Rapport notes for the next session

## Writing the Payload

For standard closes, write heavy data to `.gitmem/closing-payload.json` before calling `session_close`. The tool reads this file automatically.

```json
{
  "closing_reflection": "Session focused on auth migration...",
  "task_completion": "partial",
  "scars_to_record": [],
  "open_threads": ["Rate limiting still needs implementation"],
  "decisions": ["Chose JWT over session cookies for stateless auth"]
}
```
