description: Real stories of institutional memory preventing mistakes.
---

These are real stories from production AI agent workflows — anonymized, but not invented. Each one follows the same arc:

1. **The Situation** — An agent hits a problem during real work
2. **The Scar** — The lesson is captured as institutional memory
3. **The Save** — In a later session, `recall` surfaces the scar before the agent repeats the mistake
4. **The Takeaway** — What makes this pattern worth remembering

Every example includes actual (anonymized) snippets: the scar JSON that was created, the recall output that surfaced it, and the `confirm_scars` response that acknowledged it.

## Why Examples Matter

GitMem's value isn't theoretical. It's concrete: a warning that appears at exactly the right moment, written by a past version of you (or your team) who already made the mistake.

These stories show that loop in action.

## Available Examples

- [The Silent Migration](/docs/examples/silent-migration-wrong-directory) — A CLI tool silently reads the wrong directory, and institutional memory catches it before a database gets corrupted.
- [The Credential Leak](/docs/examples/credential-exposure-near-miss) — An agent almost prints API keys to a recorded session. A critical scar blocks it before secrets are permanently stored.
- [The Phantom Deploy](/docs/examples/committed-never-pushed) — Code is committed locally but never pushed. The agent marks it done. Production silently diverges for days.
