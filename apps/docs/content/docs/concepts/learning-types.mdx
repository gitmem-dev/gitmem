# Learning Types

GitMem supports four types of institutional memory, each serving a different purpose.

## Scars

**Mistakes to avoid.** The most common learning type. Scars are surfaced automatically via `recall` when an agent plans a similar action.

```json
{
  "learning_type": "scar",
  "title": "Always validate UUID format before DB lookup",
  "severity": "medium",
  "counter_arguments": ["Internal-only tools may trust input", "UUIDs from trusted sources are pre-validated"]
}
```

**Required fields:** title, description, severity, counter_arguments (2+)

See [Scars](/docs/concepts/scars) for details.

## Wins

**Approaches that worked well.** Capture what succeeded so you can replicate it.

```json
{
  "learning_type": "win",
  "title": "Parallel agent spawning cut review time by 60%",
  "problem_context": "Code review of 500-line PR was taking too long with sequential analysis",
  "solution_approach": "Spawned 3 agents in parallel: one for logic, one for tests, one for security"
}
```

**Required fields:** title, description

## Patterns

**Reusable strategies.** Document approaches that work in specific contexts.

```json
{
  "learning_type": "pattern",
  "title": "5-Tier Test Pyramid for MCP Servers",
  "applies_when": ["shipping MCP servers to npm", "pre-release verification"]
}
```

**Required fields:** title, description

## Anti-Patterns

**Approaches that seem good but aren't.** Document why a seemingly reasonable approach fails.

```json
{
  "learning_type": "anti_pattern",
  "title": "Don't use console.log in MCP servers",
  "description": "MCP uses stdio for JSON-RPC. Any console.log corrupts the transport. Use console.error for diagnostics."
}
```

**Required fields:** title, description

## Severity Levels

Severity applies to scars and determines surfacing priority:

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `critical` | Data loss or security risk | "Never store API keys in git" |
| `high` | Significant time waste or user impact | "Done != Deployed != Verified" |
| `medium` | Moderate friction or repeated issue | "Always validate UUIDs before DB lookup" |
| `low` | Minor optimization or preference | "Use descriptive branch names" |
