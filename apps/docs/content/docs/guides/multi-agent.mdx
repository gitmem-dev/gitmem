# Multi-Agent Workflows

GitMem supports teams of agents sharing the same institutional memory. The lead agent can inject context into sub-agents and absorb their findings.

## Context Injection

Before spawning a sub-agent, use `prepare_context` to generate a memory payload:

```
prepare_context({
  plan: "review authentication middleware",
  format: "compact"  // ~500 tokens
})
```

Formats:
- **`full`** — Rich markdown, unlimited tokens
- **`compact`** — ~500 tokens, one line per scar
- **`gate`** — ~100 tokens, blocking scars only

Include the payload in the sub-agent's prompt so it starts with institutional awareness.

## Absorbing Observations

When a sub-agent returns, capture its findings:

```
absorb_observations({
  observations: [
    {
      source: "Sub-Agent: code review",
      text: "Auth middleware doesn't validate token expiry",
      severity: "scar_candidate"
    },
    {
      source: "Sub-Agent: code review",
      text: "Good use of middleware pattern for request validation",
      severity: "info"
    }
  ]
})
```

Severity levels:
- **`info`** — Noteworthy but not actionable
- **`warning`** — Potential issue worth tracking
- **`scar_candidate`** — Should be promoted to a scar

## Best Practices

1. **Always `prepare_context` before spawning** — The 2-3 second cost prevents agents from repeating known mistakes
2. **Always `absorb_observations` after return** — Don't lose sub-agent findings
3. **Use `compact` format for most agents** — `gate` for simple tasks, `full` for complex reviews
4. **Scope by project** — Use project namespaces to keep memories relevant
