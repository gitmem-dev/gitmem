# Scars

A **scar** is a mistake captured as institutional memory. When an AI agent encounters a problem, the lesson is recorded as a scar so that future agents (or future sessions of the same agent) don't repeat it.

## How Scars Work

1. **Something goes wrong** — A deployment fails, a bug slips through, a wrong assumption costs time
2. **The scar is created** — The lesson is captured with title, description, severity, and counter-arguments
3. **Future recall surfaces it** — When an agent plans a similar action, the scar appears automatically

## Scar Anatomy

```json
{
  "learning_type": "scar",
  "title": "Done != Deployed != Verified Working",
  "description": "Marking a task as done after committing code is not enough. The full loop is: commit → push → deploy → verify the service is running and accessible.",
  "severity": "high",
  "scar_type": "process",
  "counter_arguments": [
    "For local-only changes, deployment verification is unnecessary",
    "In CI/CD pipelines, deployment may be automatic"
  ]
}
```

### Required Fields

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `title` | Short, memorable name for the lesson |
| `description` | Detailed explanation of what went wrong and how to avoid it |
| `severity` | `critical`, `high`, `medium`, or `low` |
| `counter_arguments` | At least 2 reasons why someone might reasonably ignore this scar |

### Scar Types

| Type | Decay | Use When |
|------|-------|----------|
| `process` | Never | The lesson is about how to work (e.g., "always run tests before pushing") |
| `incident` | 180 days | A specific incident that may become less relevant over time |
| `context` | 30 days | Temporary context (e.g., "API X is down, use fallback") |

## Counter-Arguments

Every scar **requires** at least 2 counter-arguments. This prevents scar accumulation from becoming a burden. Counter-arguments document when it's reasonable to ignore the scar.

Good counter-arguments:
- Describe specific scenarios where the scar doesn't apply
- Acknowledge trade-offs (speed vs safety)
- Note when the underlying cause has been fixed

## The Confirm Protocol

When scars are surfaced via `recall`, the agent must **confirm** each one before proceeding:

- **APPLYING** — "I've accounted for this lesson" (with evidence)
- **N_A** — "This scar doesn't apply to my current situation" (with reasoning)
- **REFUTED** — "I'm deliberately overriding this scar" (acknowledging risk)

This ensures scars are actively considered, not just passively displayed.
