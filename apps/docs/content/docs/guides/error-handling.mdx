# Error Handling

GitMem surfaces errors clearly so you can diagnose and fix issues quickly.

## Error Response Format

All tools return errors in a consistent format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": ["Missing required field: severity"],
  "message": "Validation failed"
}
```

The `errors` array contains specific, actionable error messages.

## Common Errors

### Invalid Session ID

```
Error: Invalid session_id format. Expected UUID (e.g., '393adb34-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx') or short ID (e.g., '393adb34'). Did you forget to run session_start first?
```

**Cause:** Passing a placeholder like `SESSION_AUTO` instead of a real session ID.
**Fix:** Call `session_start` first, then use the returned session ID.

### Missing Severity for Scars

```
Error: Missing required field: severity (must be critical, high, medium, or low)
```

**Cause:** Creating a scar without specifying severity.
**Fix:** Add `severity: "medium"` (or appropriate level) to your `create_learning` call.

### Missing Counter-Arguments

```
Error: Scars require at least 2 counter_arguments
```

**Cause:** Creating a scar with fewer than 2 counter-arguments.
**Fix:** Add at least 2 reasons why someone might reasonably ignore this scar.

## Silent Failure Prevention

GitMem tracks all fire-and-forget operations (metrics, cache writes, embeddings) via the Effect Tracker. Use `health` to see success/failure rates:

```
health({ failure_limit: 10 })
```

This surfaces any background operations that failed silently.

## MCP Transport Errors

If you see garbled JSON or "invalid JSON" errors in your MCP client:

1. GitMem uses `console.error` (stderr) for all diagnostics
2. `console.log` (stdout) is reserved for MCP JSON-RPC
3. If a plugin or extension writes to stdout, it corrupts the transport

Check that no other tools are writing to stdout in the same process.
