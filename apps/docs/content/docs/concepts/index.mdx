description: Understand the building blocks of GitMem's institutional memory system.
---

GitMem is built around a few key ideas that work together to give AI agents persistent, actionable memory.

## The Memory Loop

```
recall → work → learn → close → recall → ...
```

1. **Recall** — Before acting, check what you've learned before
2. **Work** — Do the task, applying past lessons
3. **Learn** — Capture new scars, wins, and patterns
4. **Close** — Persist session context for next time

## Key Concepts

- [Scars](/docs/concepts/scars) — Mistakes captured as institutional memory, surfaced before you repeat them
- [Sessions](/docs/concepts/sessions) — Bounded work periods with context loading and closing ceremonies
- [Threads](/docs/concepts/threads) — Unresolved work that carries across sessions
- [Learning Types](/docs/concepts/learning-types) — Scars, wins, patterns, and anti-patterns
- [Tiers](/docs/concepts/tiers) — Free (local) vs Pro (Supabase) capabilities
