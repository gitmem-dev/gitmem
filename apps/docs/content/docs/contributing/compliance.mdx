# MCP Protocol Compliance

<Callout type="success" title="36/36 PASS">
GitMem passes all MCP protocol compliance tests as of v1.0.3.
</Callout>

## Running the Suite

```bash
GITMEM_TIER=free node tests/compliance/mcp-protocol-compliance.mjs
```

The compliance test script spawns the MCP server as a child process via STDIO, performs the full JSON-RPC 2.0 handshake, validates tool schemas, executes tool calls, and tests error handling.

| Tool Execution | 10 | 10/10 |
| Error Handling | 4 | 4/4 |
| Response Format | 6 | 6/6 |
| **Total** | **36** | **36/36** |

## Category Details

### 1. Protocol Handshake (9/9)

Tests JSON-RPC 2.0 `initialize` method and `notifications/initialized` lifecycle.

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| initialize returns result | PASS |
| has protocolVersion | PASS |
| protocolVersion is string | PASS |
| has serverInfo | PASS |
| serverInfo.name exists | PASS |
| serverInfo.version exists | PASS |
| has capabilities | PASS |
| capabilities.tools exists | PASS |
| initialized notification accepted | PASS |

### 2. Tool Listing (4/4)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| tools/list returns result | PASS |
| result has tools array | PASS |
| at least 1 tool registered | PASS |
| tool count (21) is reasonable (5-100) | PASS |

21 tools in free tier. Pro tier exposes 67, dev tier 73.

### 3. Tool Schema Validation (3/3)

Every tool's `inputSchema` validated against JSON Schema and MCP spec requirements.

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| all tool schemas valid (type, required, property types, descriptions) | PASS |
| all descriptions >= 30 chars | PASS |
| no duplicate tool names | PASS |

### 4. Tool Execution (10/10)

Live tool calls via MCP STDIO transport.

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| gitmem-help returns result | PASS |
| result has content array | PASS |
| content[0].type === "text" | PASS |
| content[0].text is non-empty | PASS |
| search returns result | PASS |
| search result has content | PASS |
| search content is text type | PASS |
| recall returns result | PASS |
| recall has content array | PASS |
| log returns result | PASS |

### 5. Error Handling (4/4)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| unknown tool returns error | PASS |
| unknown method returns JSON-RPC error | PASS |
| error has numeric code | PASS |
| error code is -32601 (Method not found) | PASS |

### 6. Response Format Compliance (6/6)

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| all responses include jsonrpc: "2.0" | PASS |
| all responses include matching id | PASS |
| content block has type field | PASS |
| text block has text field | PASS |
| successful calls have isError=false or undefined | PASS |
| resources/list returns -32601 (not implemented) | PASS |

## Optional Features Not Implemented

These are valid omissions — the MCP spec does not require servers to implement all capabilities:

| Feature | Status | Reason |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `resources/list` | Not implemented (-32601) | No resources exposed; tools-only server |
| `prompts/list` | Not implemented (-32601) | No prompt templates; tool-driven UX |
| `resources/templates/list` | Not implemented | No dynamic resources |
