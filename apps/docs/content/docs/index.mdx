## What is GitMem?

Every time an AI agent makes a mistake, fixes a bug, or discovers a better approach, that knowledge disappears when the session ends. GitMem captures these lessons and surfaces them automatically before the agent takes similar actions.

<Cards>
  <Card title="Scars" href="/docs/concepts/scars">
    Mistakes captured as institutional memory. Surfaced automatically via recall before the agent repeats them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Wins" href="/docs/concepts/learning-types">
    Approaches that worked well. Document what succeeded so it can be replicated.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sessions" href="/docs/concepts/sessions">
    Bounded work periods with context loading, reflection, and clean closure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Threads" href="/docs/concepts/threads">
    Unresolved work that carries across sessions. Never lose track of open items.
  </Card>
</Cards>

## Quick Start

<div className="install-block">

```bash
npx gitmem init
```

One command sets up everything: `.gitmem/` directory, `.mcp.json`, `CLAUDE.md`, hooks, and permissions. Already have existing config? The wizard merges without destroying anything.

## How It Works

<Steps>
<Step>
### Recall before acting

Before consequential actions, the agent checks institutional memory. Relevant scars surface automatically with severity and counter-arguments.

```
recall({ plan: "deploy to production" })
// → "Done ≠ Deployed ≠ Verified Working" (high severity)
// → "Database migrations must run before code deploy" (critical)
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Confirm and apply

Each scar must be acknowledged — **APPLYING** (with evidence), **N_A** (with reasoning), or **REFUTED** (acknowledging risk). No passive dismissal.

</Step>
<Step>
### Learn from outcomes

When something breaks or works well, capture it. Scars require counter-arguments to prevent knowledge bloat.

```
create_learning({
  learning_type: "scar",
  title: "OAuth redirect URI must match exactly",
  severity: "medium",
  counter_arguments: [
    "In development, localhost variations are usually fine",
    "Some providers support wildcard redirects"
  ]
})
```

</Step>
<Step>
### Close and persist

Session close captures reflections, records scar usage, and persists open threads for the next session.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Automatic Recall** | Before taking action, agents check institutional memory for relevant lessons |
| **Confirm Protocol** | Scars require active acknowledgment — APPLYING, N_A, or REFUTED |
| **Session Continuity** | Context carries across sessions via threads, decisions, and rapport notes |
| **Multi-Agent** | Teams of agents share the same institutional memory via `prepare_context` |
| **MCP Native** | Works with Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, and any MCP client |
| **Free Tier** | Local `.gitmem/` storage with 23 tools, no external dependencies |

<Callout type="info" title="23 tools, zero cost">
The free tier includes session management, scar recall, learning creation, threads, and analytics — all stored locally in `.gitmem/`. No account, no API key, no cloud dependency.
